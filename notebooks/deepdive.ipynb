This notebook builds on that by exploring extra tools for more specialized uses, as well as demonstrating several edge-cases and extension points.

    "### Parsing awkward functions\n",
    "\n",
    "`pyiron_workflow` is predecated on being able to identify and label not just the inputs of functions, but their outputs. We try to make this convenient by scraping output labels from the raw code of the return value. But, sometimes it doesn't go that easily. Sometimes you might want to wrap an existing function, maybe it even has multiple return values! Or maybe there is no raw source code because the entire function is dynamic (e.g. a lambda function). We don't offer flexible/dynamic output -- the output still needs to be fixed at the class level -- but as long as you are willing to vouch for the function you're wrapping, you can bypass restrictions on parsability of the function code. In this case, you _must_ provide explicit output labels, and you need to set a flag to indicate that parsing should not be performed.

That means you can still write regular python inside your macro definition, but (with the exception of operations that work on data channels via node injection) you can't use that python to process input data and manipulate it because it is (a) acting on data channels not the underlying data held by those channels, and (b) happens only once to the initial data!\n",

The `.float()` method defined on the injection class gives explicit instruction to generate a new node to handle this transformation on the data values in a delayed manner.

    "This is actually some important engineering. Sending a node off to a parallel process with an executor requires serializing data to send to the new process. For `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` and those compliant with it (our expectation for these circumstances) that involves using `__getstate__` (well, `__reduce__`, but the state comes out under the hood). When we send a `Function` node off for parallel execution, we actually only send the `Function.node_function` (remember it is a `@staticmethod`!!!) and the actual input data. But for `Macro` nodes, we necessarily send the entire node so there is something there to run the subgraph! If we sent the macro's parent along, or its connections, we'd need to serialize _the entire graph_ when we run just one piece on a separate process!\n",

Otherwise we will use tools we've seen before. \n",
