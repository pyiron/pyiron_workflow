    "To jump straight to how to use `pyiron_workflow`, go look at the quickstart guide -- this jumps straight to using `Workflow` as a single-point-of-access, creating nodes with decorators, and leveraging node packages to form complex graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we start from the ground up and do \"silly\" things like importing _just_ the `Function` class directly from the `pyiron_workflow` package. This isn't meant to show actual practical, recommended use-styles, but rather is indended as a pedagogical deep-dive that builds knowledge from the ground up. While the quickstart is aimed at users who just want to get running, this is intended for people who want to develop nodes for others to use, or for people who are stuck or seeing unexpected behaviour and want a better understanding of what `pyiron_workflow` is doing under the hood.\n",

    "# Example with pre-built nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently we have a handfull of pre-build nodes available for import from the `nodes` package. Let's use these to quickly put together a workflow for looking at some MD data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To access prebuilt nodes we can `.create` them. This works both from the workflow class _and_ from a workflow instance. In the latter case, created nodes automatically take the creating workflow instance as their `parent`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few of nodes that are always available under the `Workflow.create.standard` namespace, otherwise we need to register new node packages. This is done with the `register` method, which takes the domain (namespace/key/attribute/whatever you want to call it) under which you want to register the new nodes, and a string import path to a module that has a list of nodes under the name `nodes`, i.e. the module has the property `nodes: list[pyiron_workflow.nodes.Node]`. (This API is subject to change, as we work to improve usability and bring node packages more and more in line with \"FAIR\" principles.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can make your own `.py` files with nodes for reuse this way, but `pyiron_workflow` also comes with a couple of packages. In this example we'll use atomistics and plotting:"

Under the hood this is accomplished by the macro IO \"linking\" itself to its childrens' IO, so that updates to macro input values are always immediately propagated to children, and macro output gets synchronized with its childrens' output at the end of every run. Because of this we can think of these children all having the same \"scope\", i.e. siblings among the same parent.\n",

For `__call__` it defaults to `True`, so that the search for data dependencies punches right through parents and all the way up. The danger is that this might be expensive if there's an costly node somewhere in the dependency!\n",
