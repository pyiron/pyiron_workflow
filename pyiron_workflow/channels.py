    Data channels control the flow of data on the graph.

    They store data persistently (:attr:`value`).

    This value may have a default (:attr:`default`) and the default-default is to be
    `NOT_DATA`.

    They may optionally have a type hint (:attr:`type_hint`).

    New data and new connections are tested against type hints (if any).

    In addition to the requirement of being a "conjugate pair", if both connecting
    channels have type hints, the output channel must have a type hint that is as or
    more specific than the input channel.

    In addition to connections, these channels can have a single partner
    (:attr:`value_receiver: DataChannel`) that is of the _same_ class and obeys type
    hints as though it were the "downstream" (input) partner in a connection.
    Channels with such partners pass any data updates they receive directly to this
    partner (via the :attr:`value` setter).
    (This is helpful for passing data between scopes, where we want input at one scope
    to be passed to the input of owners at a deeper scope, i.e. macro input passing to
    child node input, or vice versa for output.)

    All these type hint tests can be disabled on the input/receiving channel
    (:attr:`strict_hints: bool`), and this is recommended for the optimal performance
    in production runs.

    Channels can indicate whether they hold data they are happy with
    (:attr:`ready: bool`), which is to say it is data (not the singleton `NOT_DATA`)
    and that it conforms to the type hint (if one is provided and checking is active).

    TODO:

        - Storage (including priority and history)
        - Ontological hinting

    Some comments on type hinting:
    For simple type hints like `int` or `str`, type hint comparison is trivial.
    However, some hints take arguments, e.g. `dict[str, int]` to specify key and value
    types; `tuple[int, int, str]` to specify a tuple with certain values;
    `typing.Literal['a', 'b', 'c']` to specify particular choices;
    `typing.Callable[[float, float], str]` to specify a callable that takes particular
    argument types and has a return type; etc.
    For hints with the origin `dict`, `tuple`, and `typing.Callable`, the two hints must
    have _exactly the same arguments_ for one two qualify as "as or more specific".
    E.g. `tuple[int, int|float]` is as or more specific than
    `tuple[int|float, int|float]`, but not `tuple[int, int|float, str]`.
    For _all other hints_, we demand that the output hint arguments be a _subset_ of
    the input.
    E.g. `Literal[1, 2]` is as or more specific that both `Literal[1, 2]` and
    `Literal[1, 2, "three"]`.

    Warning:
        Type hinting in python is quite complex, and determining when a hint is
        "more specific" can be tricky. For instance, in python 3.11 you can now type
        hint a tuple with a mixture of fixed elements of fixed type, followed by an
        arbitrary elements of arbitrary type. This and other complex scenarios are not
        yet included in our test suite and behaviour is not guaranteed.

    Attributes:
        value: The actual data value held by the channel.
        label (str): The label for the channel.
        owner (pyiron_workflow.io.HasIO): The channel's owner.
        default (typing.Any|None): The default value to initialize to.
            (Default is the singleton `NOT_DATA`.)
        type_hint (typing.Any|None): A type hint for values. (Default is None.)
        strict_hints (bool): Whether to check new values, connections, and partners
            when this channel is a value receiver. This can potentially be expensive, so
            consider deactivating strict hints everywhere for production runs. (Default
            is True, raise exceptions when type hints get violated.)

    Signal channels give the option control execution flow by triggering callback

    send when they call their input connections.

    Inputs hold a callback function to call, and outputs call each of their connections.

    `some_output >> some_input` is equivalent to `some_input.connect(some_output)`.
