    A base class for nodes that have internal graph structure -- i.e. they hold a
    collection of child nodes and their computation is to execute that graph.

    Promises (in addition parent class promises):
    - The class offers access...
        - To the node-izing `pyiron_workflow` decorators
        - To a creator for other `pyiron_workflow` objects (namely nodes)
            - From the class level, this simply creates these objects
            - From the instance level, created nodes get the instance as their parent
    - Child nodes...
        - Can be added by...
            - Passing a node instance to the adding method
            - Setting the composite instance as the node's parent at node instantiation
            - Assigning a node instance as an attribute
        - Can be accessed by...
            - Attribute access using their node label
            - Attribute or item access in the child nodes collection
            - Iterating over the composite instance
        - Can be removed by method
        - Each have a unique label (within the scope of this composite)
        - Have no other parent
        - Can be replaced in-place with another node that has commensurate IO
        - Have their working directory nested inside the composite's
    - The length of a composite instance is its number of child nodes
    - Running the composite...
        - Runs the child nodes (either using manually specified execution signals, or
            leveraging a helper tool that automates this process for data DAGs --
            details are left to child classes)
        - Returns a dot-dictionary of output IO
    - Composite IO...
        - Is some subset of the child nodes IO
            - Default channel labels indicate both child and child's channel labels
            - Default behaviour is to expose all unconnected child nodes' IO
        - Bijective maps can be used to...
            - Rename IO
            - Force a child node's IO to appear
            - Force a child node's IO to _not_ appear

    Attributes:
        inputs/outputs_map (bidict|None): Maps in the form
         `{"node_label__channel_label": "some_better_name"}` that expose canonically
         named channels of child nodes under a new name. This can be used both for re-
         naming regular IO (i.e. unconnected child channels), as well as forcing the
         exposure of irregular IO (i.e. child channels that are already internally
         connected to some other child channel). Non-`None` values provided at input
         can be in regular dictionary form, but get re-cast as a clean bidict to ensure
         the bijective nature of the maps (i.e. there is a 1:1 connection between any
         IO exposed at the `Composite` level and the underlying channels).
        nodes (DotDict[pyiron_workflow.node.Node]): The owned nodes that
         form the composite subgraph.
        strict_naming (bool): When true, repeated assignment of a new node to an
         existing node label will raise an error, otherwise the label gets appended
         with an index and the assignment proceeds. (Default is true: disallow assigning
         to existing labels.)
        create (Creator): A tool for adding new nodes to this subgraph.
        starting_nodes (None | list[pyiron_workflow.node.Node]): A subset
         of the owned nodes to be used on running. Only necessary if the execution graph
         has been manually specified with `run` signals. (Default is an empty list.)
        wrap_as (Wrappers): A tool for accessing node-creating decorators

    Methods:
        add_node(node: Node): Add the node instance to this subgraph.
        remove_node(node: Node): Break all connections the node has, remove_node it from this
         subgraph, and set its parent to `None`.
        (de)activate_strict_hints(): Recursively (de)activate strict type hints.
        replace_node(owned_node: Node | str, replacement: Node | type[Node]): Replaces an
            owned node with a new node, as long as the new node's IO is commensurate
            with the node being replaced.
        register(): A short-cut to registering a new node package with the node creator.
