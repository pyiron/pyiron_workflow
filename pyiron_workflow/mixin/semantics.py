"""
Classes for "semantic" reasoning.

The motivation here is to be able to provide the object with a unique identifier
in the context of other semantic objects. Each object may have exactly one parent
and an arbitrary number of children, and each child's name must be unique in the
scope of that parent. In this way, the path from the parent-most object to any
child is completely unique. The typical filesystem on a computer is an excellent
example and fulfills our requirements, the only reason we depart from it is so that
we are free to have objects stored in different locations (possibly even on totally
different drives or machines) belong to the same semantic group.
