"""
Classes for "semantic" reasoning.

The motivation here is to be able to provide the object with a unique identifier
in the context of other semantic objects. Each object may have at most one parent,
while semantic parents may have an arbitrary number of children, and each child's name
must be unique in the scope of that parent. In this way, when semantic parents are also
themselves semantic, we can build a path from the parent-most object to any child that
is completely unique. The typical filesystem on a computer is an excellent
example and fulfills our requirements, the only reason we depart from it is so that
we are free to have objects stored in different locations (possibly even on totally
different drives or machines) belong to the same semantic group.
