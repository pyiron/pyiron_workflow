class Macro(Composite, StaticNode, ScrapesIO, ABC):
    """
    A macro is a composite node that holds a graph with a fixed interface, like a
    pre-populated workflow that is the same every time you instantiate it.

    At instantiation, the macro uses a provided callable to build and wire the graph,
    then builds a static IO interface for this graph.
    This callable must use the macro object itself as the first argument (e.g. adding
    nodes to it).
    The provided callable may optionally specify further args and kwargs; these are
    used to pre-populate the macro with :class:`UserInput` nodes, although they may
    later be trimmed if the IO can be connected directly to child node IO without any
    loss of functionality.
    This can be especially helpful when more than one child node needs access to the
    same input value.
    Similarly, the callable may return any number of child nodes' output channels (or
    the node itself in the case of single-output nodes) as long as a commensurate
    number of labels for these outputs were provided to the class constructor.
    These function-like definitions of the graph creator callable can be used
    to build only input xor output, or both together.
    Macro input channel labels are scraped from the signature of the graph creator;
    for output, output labels can be provided explicitly as a class attribute or, as a
    fallback, they are scraped from the graph creator code return statement (stripping
    off the "{first argument}.", where {first argument} is whatever the name of the
    first argument is.

    Macro IO is _value linked_ to the child IO, so that their values stay synchronized,
    but the child nodes of a macro form an isolated sub-graph.

    As with function nodes, subclasses of :class:`Macro` may define a method for creating the
    graph.

    As with :class:`Workflow``, all DAG macros can determine their execution flow
    automatically, if you have cycles in your data flow, or otherwise want more control
    over the execution, all you need to do is specify the `node.signals.input.run`
    connections and :attr:`starting_nodes` list yourself.
    If only _one_ of these is specified, you'll get an error, but if you've provided
    both then no further checks of their validity/reasonableness are performed, so be
    careful.
    Unlike :class:`Workflow`, this execution flow automation is set up once at
    instantiation;
    If the macro is modified post-facto, you may need to manually re-invoke
    :meth:`configure_graph_execution`.

    Promises (in addition parent class promises):

    - IO is...
        - Statically defined at the class level
        - By value, i.e. the macro has its own IO channel instances and children are
            duly encapsulated inside their own sub-graph
        - Value-linked to the values of their corresponding child nodes' IO -- i.e.
            updating a macro input value changes a child node's input value, and a
            child node updating its output value changes a macro output value (if that
            child's output is regularly included in the macro's output, e.g. because it
            is disconnected or otherwise included in the outputs map)
    - Macros will attempt to set the execution graph automatically for DAGs, as long as
        no execution flow is set in the function that builds the sub-graph
    - A default node label can be generated using the name of the callable that builds
        the graph.

    Examples:
        Let's consider the simplest case of macros that just consecutively add 1 to
        their input:

        >>> from pyiron_workflow import Macro, as_macro_node, macro_node
        >>> def add_one(x):
        ...     result = x + 1
        ...     return result
        >>>
        >>> def add_three_macro(self, one__x):
        ...     self.one = self.create.function_node(add_one, x=one__x)
        ...     self.two = self.create.function_node(add_one, self.one)
        ...     self.three = self.create.function_node(add_one, self.two)
        ...     self.one >> self.two >> self.three
        ...     self.starting_nodes = [self.one]
        ...     return self.three

        In this case we had _no need_ to specify the execution order and starting nodes
        --it's just an extremely simple DAG after all! -- but it's done here to
        demonstrate the syntax.

        We can make a macro by passing this graph-building function (that takes a macro
        as its first argument, i.e. `self` from the macro's perspective) to the :class:`Macro`
        class. Then, we can use it like a regular node! Just like a workflow, the
        io is constructed from unconnected owned-node IO by combining node and channel
        labels.

        >>> macro = macro_node(add_three_macro, output_labels="three__result")
        >>> out = macro(one__x=3)
        >>> out.three__result
        6

        We can also nest macros, rename their IO, and provide access to
        internally-connected IO by inputs and outputs maps:

        >>> def nested_macro(self, inp):
        ...     self.a = self.create.function_node(add_one, x=inp)
        ...     self.b = self.create.macro_node(
        ...         add_three_macro, one__x=self.a, output_labels="three__result"
        ...     )
        ...     self.c = self.create.function_node(add_one, x=self.b)
        ...     return self.c, self.b
        >>>
        >>> macro = macro_node(
        ...     nested_macro, output_labels=("out", "intermediate")
        ... )
        >>> macro(inp=1)
        {'out': 6, 'intermediate': 5}

        Macros and workflows automatically generate execution flows when their data
        is acyclic.
        Let's build a simple macro with two independent tracks:

        >>> def modified_flow_macro(self, a__x=0, b__x=0):
        ...     self.a = self.create.function_node(add_one, x=a__x)
        ...     self.b = self.create.function_node(add_one, x=b__x)
        ...     self.c = self.create.function_node(add_one, x=self.b)
        ...     return self.a, self.c
        >>>
        >>> m = macro_node(modified_flow_macro, output_labels=("a", "c"))
        >>> m(a__x=1, b__x=2)
        {'a': 2, 'c': 4}

        We can override which nodes get used to start by specifying the
        :attr:`starting_nodes` property and (if necessary) reconfiguring the execution
        signals.
        Care should be taken here, as macro nodes may be creating extra input
        nodes that need to be considered.
        It's advisable to use :meth:`draw()` or to otherwise inspect the macro's
        children and their connections before manually updating execution flows.

        Let's use this and then observe how the `a` sub-node no longer gets run:

        >>> _ = m.disconnect_run()
        >>> m.starting_nodes = [m.b]
        >>> _ = m.b >> m.c
        >>> m(a__x=1000, b__x=2000)
        {'a': 2, 'c': 2002}

        (The `_` is just to catch and ignore output for the doctest, you don't
        typically need this.)

        Note how the `a` node is no longer getting run, so the output is not updated!
        Manually controlling execution flow is necessary for cyclic graphs (cf. the
        while loop meta-node), but best to avoid when possible as it's easy to miss
        intended connections in complex graphs.

        If there's a particular macro we're going to use again and again, we might want
        to consider making a new class for it using the decorator, just like we do for
        function nodes. If no output labels are explicitly provided, these are scraped
        from the function return value, just like for function nodes (except the
        initial `macro.` (or whatever the first argument is named) on any return values
        is ignored):

        >>> @Macro.wrap.as_macro_node()
        ... def AddThreeMacro(self, x):
        ...     add_three_macro(self, one__x=x)
        ...     # We could also simply have decorated that function to begin with
        ...     return self.three
        >>>
        >>> macro = AddThreeMacro()
        >>> macro(x=0).three
        3

        Alternatively (and not recommended) is to make a new child class of
        :class:`Macro` that overrides the :meth:`graph_creator` arg such that
        the same graph is always created.

        >>> class AddThreeMacro(Macro):
        ...     _output_labels = ["three"]
        ...
        ...     @staticmethod
        ...     def graph_creator(self, x):
        ...         add_three_macro(self, one__x=x)
        ...         return self.three
        >>>
        >>> macro = AddThreeMacro()
        >>> macro(x=0).three
        3

        We can also modify an existing macro at runtime by replacing nodes within it, as
        long as the replacement has fully compatible IO. There are three syntacic ways
        to do this. Let's explore these by going back to our `add_three_macro` and
        replacing each of its children with a node that adds 2 instead of 1.

        >>> @Macro.wrap.as_function_node()
        ... def add_two(x):
        ...     result = x + 2
        ...     return result
        >>>
        >>> adds_six_macro = macro_node(add_three_macro, output_labels="three__result")
        >>> # With the replace method
        >>> # (replacement target can be specified by label or instance,
        >>> # the replacing node can be specified by instance or class)
        >>> replaced = adds_six_macro.replace_child(adds_six_macro.one, add_two())
        >>> # With the replace_with method
        >>> adds_six_macro.two.replace_with(add_two())
        >>> # And by assignment of a compatible class to an occupied node label
        >>> adds_six_macro.three = add_two
        >>> adds_six_macro(one__x=1)
        {'three__result': 7}

        It's possible for the macro to hold nodes which are not publicly exposed for
        data and signal connections, but which will still internally execute and store
        data, e.g.:

        >>> @Macro.wrap.as_macro_node("lout", "n_plus_2")
        ... def LikeAFunction(self, lin: list,  n: int = 1):
        ...     self.plus_two = n + 2
        ...     self.sliced_list = lin[n:self.plus_two]
        ...     self.double_fork = 2 * n
        ...     return self.sliced_list, self.plus_two.channel
        >>>
        >>> like_functions = LikeAFunction(lin=[1,2,3,4,5,6], n=3)
        >>> sorted(like_functions().items())
        [('lout', [4, 5]), ('n_plus_2', 5)]

        >>> like_functions.double_fork.value
        6
