        We compare names instead of direct `is` comparisons with the imported objects
        because the class factories are being forced to create new classes on repeated
        import, i.e. we don't leverage classfactory's ability to make the dynamic
        classes be the same object.
        This is because users might _intentionally_ be re-calling the factories, e.g.
        with new output labels, and we then _want_ new classes to get generated.
        There is probably a workaround that lets us have our cake and eat it to (i.e.
        only generate new classes when they are strictly needed), but we don't have it
        now.
